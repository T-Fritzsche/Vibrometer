# Vibrometer
Matlab based measurement setup for a vibrometer surface-scan

I wrote this setup during my master thesis. The idea is to use a
laser-vibrometer (Polytec) to measure the suface velocity and displacement
over the surface of an ultrasonic transducer. The transducer is excited with a
sinusoidal voltage and moved below the vibrometer head. An oscilloscope
measures both the exciting and velocity-dependend voltage from the vibrometer
which will be saved in a mat file.
